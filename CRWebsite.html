        I live in Lynn, Massachusetts with my mom, dad, and twin sister. I enjoy gardening, reading, and playing videogames. I like the color orange, family and friends, food, and sleeping. I dislike tests, politics, and shoveling snow. My current dream is to get a degree and a stable job so I can support my sister in her dreams of being a doctor and making a stable life for myself.
